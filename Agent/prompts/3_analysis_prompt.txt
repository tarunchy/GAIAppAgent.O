Given the following normal ranges for grid operations:
- Consumption (kWh): 40-200 kWh (Normal Load)
- Voltage (V): 230-245 V
- Frequency (Hz): 49.5-50.5 Hz

And some sample records, determine the "Scenario" and "Reason" for each record. The possible scenarios are:
- Normal Load
- High Load
- Low Load
- Error
- Severe Issue
- Outage
- Emergency Attention

For the "Reason," provide an explanation based on the deviations from the normal ranges.
